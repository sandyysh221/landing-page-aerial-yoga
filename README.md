# Landing Page Project for SheCodes Basic

My first coding project! 🙌 

During SheCodes Basics, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. For a final project, we were to create a simple landing page composed of what we learned in the past few weeks and I decided to create a page on one of my hobbies: aerial yoga.

A simple Javascript function was also created to make the page more interactive. The "Find aerial yoga near you?" button would prompt the user to input their name, email address, and if they liked yoga. Depending on their yes/no answer, they will receive a different alert message and `h1` will change to a different parting message. [Example Screenshots](https://github.com/sandyysh221/landing-page-aerial-yoga/new/main?readme=1#screenshot-when-user-clicks-yes) 

**Note:** User inputs are ***not*** saved anywhere thus no email will be sent out.
